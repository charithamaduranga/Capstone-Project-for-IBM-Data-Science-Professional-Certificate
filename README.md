# Capstone-Project-for-IBM-Data-Science-Professional-Certificate

### This capstone project was a part of IBM Data Science Professional Certificate program.  
The objective of the project was to find similar neighborhoods (i.e. districts) between New York and Toronto where both are largest metropolitan areas in the world with vast diversification.  
k-mean clustering algorithm was used to cluster neighborhoods of these largest metropolitans based on the venues/venues categories surrounded by their neighborhoods. Folium library was used to illustrate clustered neighborhoods on a maps.

#### <ins> Key activities carried out. </ins>
 - Data sources were obtained including neighborhoods and their longitude and latitude scraping websites.
 - Foursquare APIs were used to obtain surrounded venues in each neighborhood
 - Data Analysis and visualization was done in jupyter notebook 
 - K-mean clustering was used to cluster neighborhoods of both cities.
 - Five clusters were obtained and difference of each cluster was illustrated based on the significance of each venue in each cluster
 - Folium was used to illustrate clustered neighborhoods on a map
 - A Report and a presentation was submitted together with the jupyter notebook which can be view through [github repository](https://github.com/charithamaduranga/Capstone-Project-for-IBM-Data-Science-Professional-Certificate/blob/5ff256c41b8e5b5fe37e3764624f0d7845e04523/Capstone%20Report%20-%20week2.pdf).
